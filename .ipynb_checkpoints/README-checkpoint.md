# CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3
Behavioral Cloning Project of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer

# **Proyect: Behavioral Cloning**

---

## **Overview**

This is the third proyect of Nanodegree Self-Driving Car Engineer.

The objective of the project is to build a behavioral cloning network. To do this, you have to drive a car around
a track in a simulator provided for Udacity, collect the data and then train a deep neural network to do the driving for you.

## **Software**
- *Python* as programming language.
- *Jupiter* as programming environtment.
- *Keras* as a high-level neural networks API.
- *OpenCV* as library of computer vision.
- *numpy* as library of mathematical functions
- *scikit-learn* as library of utilities for machine learning.


## **File List**

The project consists of the following files:

- *model.py* containing the script to create and train the model.
- *drive.py* for  driving the car in autonomous mode.
- *model.h5* containing a trained convolution neural network built with Keras.
- *writeup.md* summarizing the results.
- *video.mp4* showing a test lap on a track of the simulator.
- *examples*: A folder with the images used in the writeup.
